1. Check if the file exists:

ls -la ~

Look for .bashrc in the output. If it's missing, you'll need to create it.

2. Create a new .bashrc file:

If the file is indeed missing, you can create a new one by running:

touch ~/.bashrc

nano ~/.bashrc


# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash for non-login shells.

# set a colorful prompt
PS1='[\u@\h \W]\$ '

# enable color support of ls and add handy aliases
if [ -x /usr/bin/dircolors ]; then
    eval "$(dircolors)"
fi
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
alias ll='ls -l'

Save and close the file (in nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, then Enter).


3. Source the new .bashrc:

After creating or updating the .bashrc file, run the following command again to apply the changes:

source ~/.bashrc
